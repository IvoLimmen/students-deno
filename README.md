# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in TypeScript using Deno.

## Requirements

* Deno 1.37.2

## Run

```
deno run app.ts
```

Type `help` for the list of commands.
When you type `end` or `quit` it will show the averages per course per student.

# Evaluation

The good:

  * You can use classes and proper OO.
  * Console.log is actually correctly implemented so I needed to fix a formatting issue (bug in Node!)
  * Nice to work with TypeScript directly

The bad:

  * Documentation was difficult to find regarding specifics (importing/exporting mostly).

The ugly:

  * None yet.
